              <p>These Babies are here to fuck shit up, they are relentless, they do what they want. Whether that's
                Sinking Mom and Dads Yacht, Stealing Elons Rocket Ship or buying Illicit Drugs They Live off Mom and

              <p>By Adopting one of these Trust Fund Babies and Staking them at the Camp, you will earn a portion of
                their Trust Fund via P2E, as Mom and Dad are just sick of their shit</p>
              <p>While at Camp they will grow and learn new traits which increases your P2E (Play2Earn) Potential since
                they will become more Rare and Educated Individuals in the MetaVerse</p>
              <p>Eventually you will see Trust Fund Babies grow into Trust Fund Teens but you will only be able to Mint
                a Trust Fund Teen into the MetaVerse if you own a Trust Fund Baby and have Staked your Baby for 30 days
                minimum</p>
